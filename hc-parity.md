## Miscelaneous
### Normal Turn Order

2. Either swap active Hermit with AFK or attack
3. End turn and apply Burn/Poison damage

**CREO/HC10:** (Strict)
1. Play AFK Hermit(s)
2. Attach an Item card to a Hermit
3. Play Attach effect(s)
4. Either
    - Swap active Hermit with AFK
    - Play a Single Use effect and/or attack
5. Apply Burn/Poison damage
6. End Turn

### Status Effects
**Online:** Burn ignores all effect cards. Beefy Tunes and Totem/Deathloop remove Burn, Poison, Sleep, Bad Omen, Slowness, and Royal Protection from affected Hermits.

**CREO:** Burn ignores all effect cards besides armor. Beefy Tunes only removes Burn and Poison from affected Hermits. Totem/Deathloop do not remove any 'statuses' when reviving Hermits.

**HC10:** Burn is functionally the same as poison, both deal 20 damage until affected hermit is knocked-out.
